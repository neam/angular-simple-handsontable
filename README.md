# angular-simple-handsontable

An angular directive that can be used instead of [ngHandsontable](http://handsontable.github.io/ngHandsontable/) to increase performance and decrease algorithmic complexity.

The goal of this project is to provide a simple wrapper as possible to be able to use handsontable in angular projects, without introducing unnecessary magic and complexity. 

This means a less declarative, but cleaner, handsontable angular integration than current alternatives.  

Usage example and demo: [http://jsbin.com/vareba/edit?html,js,output]()
